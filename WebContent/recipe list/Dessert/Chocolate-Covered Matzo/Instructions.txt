Method:
1.) Drizzle the matzot with 3 tablespoons caramel sauce, then top with 1/3 cup coarsely-chopped pecans and 1/4 cup toasted coconut chips.
2.) Place 2 tablespoons pre-rinsed quinoa in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Toast for 3 to 5 minutes until the quinoa is fragrant, slightly puffed, and lightly golden brown. Remove from the heat and sprinkle over matzot. Top with 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped salted pistachios and 3 tablespoons dried cranberries. 
3.) Drizzle the matzot with 3 tablespoons melted white chocolate, then top with 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped crystallized ginger and 3 tablespoons dried blueberries. 
4.) Using a small knife, cut the zest of an orange into very thin pieces. Top the matzot with a few strips of orange zest (or candied orange peel), 1/3 cup pomegranate seeds, and 1/4 cup mini white chocolate chips. 
5.) Drizzle the matzot with 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons natural nut butter. If the nut butter is too thick to drizzle, stir in a bit of melted coconut oil. Top with 2 tablespoons toasted slivered almonds, 3 teaspoons honey, and a sprinkle of sea salt (such as Maldon).
