Ingredients:
225g quinoa
25g butter
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
400g chicken
 mini fillets
1½ tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
300g vine tomato, roughly chopped
handful pitted black kalamata olives
1 red onion, finely sliced
100g feta cheese, crumbled
small bunch mint
 leaves, chopped
juice and zest ½ lemon

Method:
1) Cook the quinoa following the pack instructions, then rinse in cold water and drain thoroughly.
2) Meanwhile, mix the butter, chilli and garlic into a paste. Toss the chicken fillets in 2 tsp of the olive oil with some seasoning. 
Lay in a hot griddle pan and cook for 3-4 mins each side or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate, dot with the spicy butter and set

3) Next, tip the tomatoes, olives, onion, feta and mint into a bowl. Toss in the cooked quinoa. 
Stir through the remaining olive oil, lemon juice and zest, and season well. Serve with the chicken fillets on top,
drizzled with any buttery chicken juices.
